## Overview

The Book Shop Management System is a console-based application developed in C++. It serves as a comprehensive tool for managing a virtual book store. The system incorporates various functionalities:
```
Data Collection and Storage:
~ The program utilizes web scraping techniques to extract book-related data.
~ This data includes book titles, authors, publishers, prices, and stock availability.

User Interaction:
It provides an intuitive interface allowing users to perform several actions:

Add New Books:
Users can input and store information about new books, including author details, titles, publishers, pricing, and available stock.

Display Current Inventory:
The system allows users to view the current collection of books available in the store.

Purchase Books:
Customers can buy books from the inventory, reducing the available stock accordingly.

Search Functionality:
Users can search for specific books based on titles and author names.

Edit Book Details:
The system permits authorized users to modify the details of existing books, such as updating prices or changing stock positions.

Object-Oriented Structure:
~ The program is structured using object-oriented principles, with a `book` class managing book-related operations.
~ The class includes methods for data entry, display, search, and modification.

This application is a practical implementation demonstrating C++ programming concepts, input/output handling, object-oriented design, and basic data management within a simulated book store environment.
